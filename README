+++++++++++++++++++
a MySQL schema synchronization utility
http://www.schemasync.org


SYNOPSIS
========
schemasync [options] <source> <target>

# source/target format: mysql://user:pass@host:port/database
# output format: <database>[_<tag>].YYYYMMDD.(patch|revert)[_<version>].sql


DESCRIPTION
===========
Schema Sync will generate the SQL necessary to migrate the schema of a source database to a target database (patch script), as well as a the SQL necessary to undo the changes after you apply them (revert script).

* Schema Sync does not alter your database. It only generates the .sql files containing the differences. You must apply the changes. 
* Schema Sync does not yet recognize Tables or Columns that have been renamed. A rename will result in the old table or column being dropped and the new one added. 
* All ADD|MODIFY COLUMN statements have the AFTER (or FIRST) SQL syntax even if no move is required. 
* COMMENTS and AUTO_INCREMENT values are not by synced by default. See help (-h) for details.
* Partitions (MySQL 5.1+) are not yet supported
